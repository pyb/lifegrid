V2 "Spec":
----

"Item" = Task | Resource

* UI functions:

~For each item, render:
- item info:
 name
 number
 cost
 progress

- Render:Relationships with other items?
Hover->arrow?
Pass the relationships

- Register click on item

- maybe a companion icon.

----

* game/*.ts functions:

- Resolving keypress / item clicked
 Launch a buy

- Actions?
 - Buy resource
 - Task launch
 
~ game loop:
 - compute progress
 - completions
 - self generation (if any)

~ produce views. possibly:
 - item costs
 - what a click would do? "click map" resource->action
 - relationships (arrows/flows) for visual
 - Progress speed for each item (depends on other vars)
 
~ State:
 - ongoing tasks/resources (Progress for each item )
 - Number of each resource
 - Duration dividers ? Task speeds?
 
-----

Data :

Task outcomes
Resources:

- Cost (if buying from other resources)
[maybe -Cost (if buying via task)] => see task outcomes
- Item duration (task or resource buy)

Don't hesitate to firstly use Hardcoded gain functions / State updates

Initial state / quantities

What resource at what level
Companion list vs prestige

------

Structuring the code

"Big-Declarative" ? Lots of code/functions in game/data/ts ?

-----------------------------------

* Rules


5 resources
$, Companion, Tool (Shovel, Hoe, ...), Crop (Coffee, ...), Farm
(Hidden 7th, I guess: Prestige)

But Only 2 I can click on to buy  : Farm, Companion

-> Some bought via other resources
-> Some created via tasks
-> Some generated via other resources

3 tasks:
Work (Job)
Build
Level (automatic)

---------

Principles:
A
Rapid clicking on tasks


B
Progression system (Level ; + prestige ie companion (cow) mechanic)


C
Farms has all the production

D, E...

------

Cow makes farm quicker
Farm produces cow (manual click)

Farm costs $ and generate $

Farm + tool makes coffee continuously. Rate depends on farms and Tool (multiplier?).
 [ eg : const coffeeRate = (gs) => A*gs.farms * (B +C * toolboost(gs.toolLevel)); or sth. Does toolboost depend on farms ? (ie superlinear?) it it an exponent? farms^toolboostexponent(toolLevel)? ]

Coffee makes tasks faster (formula : coffee level vs task?). sublinear "task speed vs coffee" ? log or sqrt formula? 

Tool slot has a tool with a n/100 progress counter, increased by Build task [rename it? Upgrade task?]
-> line of tools for each level

Farms are central and accumulating them should be satisfying... (inc. icons?)

Job creates $
Farm creates
Build creates

--------


Tasks: click task always starts if no other current task (does prestige allow for > 1 tasks? Y)

Task speed:
Frequent (1s or less) / low reward ;  or slow/high reward: Level

"Level Up" can be started early on but has v slow progress.
Speeded up by ...? 
Is it in fact a task? If so, not limited by max simultaneous tasks.


Resources can be bought via task ; or combination of other resources (multiple combos possible, more or less expensive) ; or ....


---

Level progression:
3 Resources change : Tool, Farm, maybe Coffee ;  but Dollar, companion, Level don't

If "coffee" changes (to what?), I can click on tasks quicker, or have more on the go

---

Prestige [as opposed to level] : allow for >1 tasks?

What automation, if any?
