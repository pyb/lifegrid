V2 "Spec":
----

----------

Tomorrow : 1) focus on the maybe hard part (?) : finding clean structure for the "evolving costs and rates" part
2) Maybe Review design, find additional "fun"

-----------------------------------

* Rules


5 resources
$, Companion, Tool (Shovel, Hoe, ...), Crop (Coffee, ...), Farm
(Hidden 7th, I guess: Prestige)

But Only 2 I can click on to buy  : Farm, Companion

-> Some bought via other resources
-> Some created via tasks
-> Some generated via other resources

****... and importantly, these costs and rates evolve over time!

3 tasks:
Work (Job)
Build
Level (automatic)

---------

Principles:
A
Rapid clicking on tasks


B
Progression system (Level ; + prestige ie companion (cow) mechanic)


C
Farms has all the production

D, E...

---------

Cow makes farm quicker
Farm produces cow (manual click)

Farm costs $ and generate $

Farm + tool makes coffee continuously. Rate depends on farms and Tool (multiplier?).
 [ eg : const coffeeRate = (gs) => A*gs.farms * (B +C * toolboost(gs.toolLevel)); or sth. Does toolboost depend on farms ? (ie superlinear?) it it an exponent? farms^toolboostexponent(toolLevel)? ]

Coffee makes tasks faster (formula : coffee level vs task?). sublinear "task speed vs coffee" ? log or sqrt formula? 

Tool slot has a tool with a n/100 progress counter, increased by Build task [rename it? Upgrade task?]
-> line of tools for each level

Farms are central and accumulating them should be satisfying... (inc. icons?)

Job creates $
Farm creates
Build creates

--------


Tasks: click task always starts if no other current task (does prestige allow for > 1 tasks? Y)

Task speed:
Frequent (1s or less) / low reward ;  or slow/high reward: Level

"Level Up" can be started early on but has v slow progress.
Speeded up by ...? 
Is it in fact a task? If so, not limited by max simultaneous tasks.


Resources can be bought via task ; or combination of other resources (multiple combos possible, more or less expensive) ; or ....


---

Level progression:
3 Resources change : Tool, Farm, maybe Coffee ;  but Dollar, companion, Level don't

If "coffee" changes (to what?), I can click on tasks quicker, or have more on the go

---

Prestige [as opposed to level] : allow for >1 tasks?

What automation, if any?
