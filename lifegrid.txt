V2 "Spec":
----

Data model:

Resources can have:
-Constant generation
-Cost : resource->resource
-Task generation

Furthermore One task autostarts and has variable growth rate.

All these depend on resource levels (and any other variables, or not ! Important!)


The solution?
Let's call that "the build" or "the rates" : what determines the numbers above. I think it's just "resources"
function computeBuild(resources, <any other args>)
This even could be a hardcoded function in data.ts
"the build" It' probably the wrong word. It's more like the effect of a build

nTasks
resource growth
Resource cost in terms of other resources
Speed of each Task



-----------------------------------

* Rules


5 resources
$, Companion, Tool (Shovel, Hoe, ...), Crop (Coffee, ...), Farm
(Hidden 7th, I guess: Prestige)

But Only 2 I can click on to buy  : Farm, Companion

-> Some bought via other resources
-> Some created via tasks
-> Some generated via other resources

****... and importantly, these costs and rates evolve over time!

3 tasks:
Work (Job)
Build
Level (automatic)

---------

Principles:
A
Rapid clicking on tasks


B
Progression system (Level ; + prestige ie companion (cow) mechanic)


C
Farms has all the production

D : automation

---------

Cow makes farm quicker
Farm produces cow (manual click)

Farm costs $ and generate $

Farm + tool makes coffee continuously. Rate depends on farms and Tool (multiplier?).
 [ eg : const coffeeRate = (gs) => A*gs.farms * (B +C * toolboost(gs.toolLevel)); or sth. Does toolboost depend on farms ? (ie superlinear?) it it an exponent? farms^toolboostexponent(toolLevel)? ]

Coffee makes tasks faster (formula : coffee level vs task?). sublinear "task speed vs coffee" ? log or sqrt formula? 

Tool slot has a tool with a n/100 progress counter, increased by Build task [rename it? Upgrade task?]
-> line of tools for each level

Farms are central and accumulating them should be satisfying... (inc. icons?)

Job creates $
Farm creates
Build creates

--------


Tasks: click task always starts if no other current task (does prestige allow for > 1 tasks? Y)

Task speed:
Frequent (1s or less) / low reward ;  or slow/high reward: Level

"Level Up" can be started early on but has v slow progress.
Speeded up by ...? 
Is it in fact a task? If so, not limited by max simultaneous tasks.


Resources can be bought via task ; or combination of other resources (multiple combos possible, more or less expensive) ; or ....


-----

Prestige [as opposed to level] : allow for >1 tasks?
Or better companion with different features?

-----------

R: dollar, farm, tool, companion, crop

Farm cost : 2000 or 200+cow
(Might change role of cow below though)

100 tool to upgrade -> self buy(what did i mean? Spend something to buy the same? What does that mean?)

Farm + tool = crop prod rate (auto)

Crop = faster tasks. Why? How ? Sublinear
Crop can buy dollar. Click on dollar
Or allow faster tasks

Tool levels:
Lvl1: spoon, knife, shovel...
Lvl2: drill,..., bulldozer...

How to buy tool upgrade? Build task

Principle D should be automation
Via resource 6 worker? No, via companion.

Crop -> cow! (Or workhorse)
N cows = automation speed

-----------------------------------

For real?
R: dollar, farm, tool, companion, crop
T: Work, Build, Level (auto)

* Work
100$/job, 10s
Or 100$*F(farm) / job, 10s  where F(farm) = 1 + D * sqrt(farm) ?
I want D such that say 1 farm => 1.2, 2 farm => 1.33, ... 

* Farm
Farm cost : 1000

* Tool
10 tool/Build
100 tool to upgrade 
Getting Tool upgrade : Get 100 tool. Second tool upgrades at 1000 tool, etc
Can I get tool faster wrt Build? Design choice: no for now.
Task speed divided by 2^(tool level)?

* Crop
Farm + tool = crop generation Farm ^ A*ToolLevel*. Try A=1
(or maybe Farm ^ A*ToolLevel*log(Farm)/C(Level)*)
where C(Level is a level-dependent constant?)

Crop Flow : crop converts to dollar. try 1 Potato = 1 dollar. 1 lvl2 crop = 10 dollar etc
    Turn a Crop->$ "flow" on and off by clicking on crop.
    It is a modal. Add a green $ icon/text when selling. Hover says "start selling" or "stop selling"
500 Crop -> cow! (Or workhorse)

* Level upgrades
Crop upgrades by Level
Tool range upgrade by Level

Tool levels:
Lvl1: spoon, knife, shovel...
Lvl2: drill,..., bulldozer...

Crop Level:
1:Potato 2:Corn 3:Rice...

------ Certainty line

Cows/Workhorse/Companion/Pet = automation speed
Automate what ? Latest clicked
Autoclick rate: 

Level speed? function of Farms, maybe Cow
--- Hypothesis - bc I don't know what the game will want.

Cows drive automation.
Other pets behave qualitatively differently.
--

Design :
1 cow does 1 work click every 10s
1 cow work = 1$, human work = 100$. Different progress colors!
Clicks linear with cows : 10 cows = 1click/s. But early cows are expensive. Cow obtention is superlinear or exponential[?] over time
Cow clicks are lost if task speed is low (say 5s when cows click every 1s)
However, task speed also should go up, so that player ensures cow clicks aren't lost

At what point should cow work be more effective than human work ? What should be the income ratio of fully manual vs fully automatic?

------

To do : resource build speed? Not addressed (Farm build speed, anything else?)
Let's make it initially "fast enough that it's not an issue", but still not infinite

and prestige mechanic?
 How do I prestige?
 A better companion is supplied.
 What's the new goal revealed? I need to see an objective I hadn't seen before.

------ Theme, Renaming things

Level =>

----------

Struggling to keep whole thing in my head !...
=> High level features / Code structure.


Render (tsx)
 => progress
 => text, hover costs, info...
 => ... ? 
[finish later]

Click / settimeout management
 [done]

on click
 => check if resource available / task possible, and start it
[done]

Views : gs (build) =>
 X compute resource growth rates 
 task speeds (clicked)
 special : level task speed
 resource generation rate
[] 

gameLoop
 task progress
 resource progress
 resource generation
[]

Level up
[] 
[Prestige up]

-----

Task speed design:
Fixed goal 100, aka taskGoal

-----


Phase 2:
Views => task autoclick rate
gameLoop =>  task autoclick
in gamelopp: stop selling crops if crop < 1


----

Special features

Crop can sell to dollars (modal, click on/off)
Level task is special

-----


---

Do Farms get upgraded wrt Level?

Render: Can complete last ? no need for all the info at first.
