Design notes ... Let's make a thing!
Resource Grid Ripped off

* Decisions?

Exponential vs superlinear? Sup
UI elements ? Grid of squares? That's resource grid. Resource grid with 2 grids?
Left : the "resource-grid" grid
Right: ???

Grids: 3x3 left, 2x3 right


Ideas I had?
Farm : $/Farming or wheat/farming will improve
Task : Education. Slow!!  $/job will improve.
only 1 task at a time

Show costs on buttons ? Even only by hover
